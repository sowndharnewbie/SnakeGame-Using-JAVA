# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and Swing.

## Description

The Snake game is a popular retro arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes apples. The objective is to guide the snake to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game screen or its own body.

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game using Swing components. It includes features such as snake movement, apple generation, collision detection, and scoring. The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
